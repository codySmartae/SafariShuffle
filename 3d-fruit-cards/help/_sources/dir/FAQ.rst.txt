1. How to add more levels

   | Open config.json edit the *data* object, add a new object with its key as the category name and its value 
   as an array of game items

.. code-block:: json
   :linenos:

    ...
    "data":{
      "level":{
        "mycategory":[
          {
            "id":1,
            "board":"4x3",
            "path":"data/item_1.jpg"
          },
          {
            "id":2,
            "board":"5x4",
            "path":"data/item_2.jpg"
          }
        ]
      }
    }

2. How to customize the difficulty level

   | Each difficulty level is determined by values of *moveIteration* property in config.json. Changing *moveIteration* value will increase or decrease the difficulty. This example means EASY = 40, MEDIUM = 200 and HARD = 1000 iterations

.. code-block:: json

    "moveIteration":[40, 200, 1000]
